# Python-Practice

This Python Practice Sheet is designed to help you improve your skills in various programming concepts and problem-solving using Python. It covers a range of topics, including line breaks, counting occurrences of characters in a string, palindrome, LCM (Least Common Multiple), treemap, Fahrenheit to Celsius converter, BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator, chessboard function, language detector, and password authentication.
Each exercise in the practice sheet is designed to provide you with a problem statement, along with examples and hints (if applicable). Your task is to implement the solution using Python programming.
List of Exercises
1.	Line Breaks: Implement a function to break a given string into multiple lines of a specified width.
2.	Count Occurrences of Characters in a String: Create a function that counts the occurrences of each character in a given string.
3.	Palindrome: Implement a function to check if a given string is a palindrome or not.
4.	LCM (Least Common Multiple): Write a function to find the least common multiple of two given numbers.
5.	Treemap: Create a function that maps a given function over a list and returns a new list with the function applied to each element.
6.	Fahrenheit to Celsius Converter: Implement a function to convert a temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius.
7.	BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator: Write a function to calculate the BMI based on weight and height inputs.
8.	Chessboard Function: Implement a function that generates a chessboard pattern using asterisks and spaces.
9.	Language Detector: Create a function that analyzes a given text and attempts to detect the language of the text.
10.	Password Authentication: Write a function to authenticate a user's password based on certain criteria, such as length and character requirements.
